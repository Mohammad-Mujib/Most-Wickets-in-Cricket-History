This repo is for the second project of Ironhack Data Analysis Bootcamp. 


## Description 🔎 ➡️ 💻

In this project here I am working with a dataset that contains the data of all the famous International Cricket Bowlers and their gained wickets and other interesting data.
During the project I will analyze this dataset to get the information about each palayers and about their cricket career. And in the final of this project I will show the clients with a Dashboard which player will be appropriate for them to sign for any important cricket league.
